# Checklist!



## Checklist using Jquery/ajax, node, express, postgresql.

This is a basic checklist project to demonstrate a simple full stack application, built in a weekend. 

Please setup your database with the name weekend-to-do-app, and run the table setup and dummy data (if desired) queries found in the database.sql file.

This project uses Node.js. Install node on your machine, and use the command npm install from within this project directory to install all dependencies.
